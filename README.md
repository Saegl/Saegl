## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alisher Zhubanyshev. I have BSc in CS. I like to build all kind of stuff in Python and Rust.

### Chess
I like chess so much I made chess engine that plays chess [Dinora](https://github.com/DinoraChess/dinora). It uses Deep neural networks to evaluate positions and Monte Carlo Trees to search best move

### Compilers and interpreters
I really like [Crafting Interpreters book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). And so I have many attempts to make my own programming language: [pylox](https://github.com/Saegl/pylox), [loxit](https://github.com/Saegl/loxit), [liasis](https://github.com/Saegl/liasis), [nigthjar](https://github.com/Saegl/nightjar)
