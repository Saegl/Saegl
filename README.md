### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alisher Zhubanyshev, Computer Science student at [SDU](https://sdu.edu.kz/). I like to build all kind of stuff in Python and I'm trying to learn Rust (with no success). Also like to play chess [my lichess account](https://lichess.org/@/Saegl). I like chess so much I made chess engine that play chess [Dinora](https://github.com/DinoraChess/dinora). Interested in learning deep learning, actually my chess engine uses some Keras / Tensorflow, which have to be improved.
