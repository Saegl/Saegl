## Hi there

I'm Alisher Zhubanyshev, a curious software developer with a BSc in Computer Science. I love exploring different technologies and enjoy building projects that challenge me to learn and grow (especially in Python and Rust)

### Chess

I'm passionate about chess and created a chess engine called [Dinora](https://github.com/DinoraChess/dinora). It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to evaluate positions and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to find the best moves. This project taught me valuable skills in building and exploring datasets, implementing effective storage solutions, and developing chess-specific heuristics for data compression. I also developed metrics to evaluate model performance and tested the engine through competitive matches using Elo ratings

### Compilers and Interpreters

I'm fascinated by the [Crafting Interpreters book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). This has inspired me to experiment with creating my own programming languages, such as [pylox](https://github.com/Saegl/pylox), [loxit](https://github.com/Saegl/loxit), [liasis](https://github.com/Saegl/liasis), [nigthjar](https://github.com/Saegl/nightjar)

### Linux

I'm an enthusiast of GNU/Linux/NixOS/Neovim, which I use as my daily driver. You can check out my configurations in my [nixos dotfiles](https://github.com/Saegl/nixos) and [neovim](https://github.com/Saegl/nvim)
